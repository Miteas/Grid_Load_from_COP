This project provides a tool for simulating and analysing the grid load impact of heat pumps. It includes features for data processing, visualization, and interactive analysis of heat pump performance and electricity consumption across different scenarios.
Features

Data processing and normalization of heat pump performance data
Calculation of Coefficient of Performance (COP) using Richards function
Interactive visualization of heat output and electricity input
Yearly statistics calculation and export
Dynamic grid load simulation for varying numbers of heat pumps
Interactive plots and tables for result analysis
